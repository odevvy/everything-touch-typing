# Why you should learn how to type without looking at your keyboard
## Flow
All brain cycles go into solving the problem at hand, not searching for the right keys to press.

## Speed
Enables you to get the code out of your head quicker and onto the screen, resulting in faster iteration cycles.
Prompts for LLMs, team communications and documention also become a breeze.

## Joy
Coupled with the right keyboard switches + keyboard design, the tactile feel and sound of typing, just feels...so...damn...good.

OK those benefits sound amazing!
But where and how to start?

# How can I learn to type without looking at the keyboard?
## Steps:
**1. Dedictate 10 minutes every day to practice typing.**
Practicing a short time daily is better than hours intermittently.
No skipping or compromises. Consistency is key.

**2. Learn the correct basic typing technique.**
[typing.com](https://typing.com)

This site is great to start with.
The exercizes are gamified and fun, progressively teaching the correct keyboard finger placement.

Target 30 words per minute (wpm), before moving on to the next step.

The topic of wpm is actually more layered than one thinks it is. I will make a future post about why this is and my observations.

**4. Move to keybr**
[keybr.com](https://keybr.com)

In the settings switch off:
- Stop cursor on error
- Forgive errors
Leaving them on gives a false sense of security/accomplishment in the long run.

The words on keybr are overall longer than typing.com, but not too long.

Target 60wpm with 95% accuracy, before moving on to the next step.

**5.  Move to Monkeytype
[Monkeytype.com](https://monkeytype.com)

On the start test screen,
Enable in the top bar:
- punctuation
- words
- 50 words
Below the top bar pick the following wordset:
- English 25k 

Moving from keybr, you will see an initial drop in speed.
This is normal - you are working with a larger, unfamiliar word set and also typing more words per practice session.

Monkeytype is the platform where one can refine your typing and practice to get to that  sweet 100+ wpm zone.

I am still experimenting with settings on monkeytype and will share future updates as I uncover more.
