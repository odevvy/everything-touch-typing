# Why you should learn how to type without looking at your keyboard
## Flow
All brain cycles go into solving the problem at hand, not searching for the right keys to press.

## Speed
Enables you to get the code out of your head quicker and onto the screen, resulting in faster iteration cycles.
Prompts for LLMs, team communications and documention also become a breeze.

## Joy
Coupled with the right keyboard switches + keyboard design, the tactile feel and sound of typing, just feels...so...damn...good.

OK those benefits sound amazing!
But where and how to start?

# How can I learn to type without looking at the keyboard?
## Steps:
**1. Dedictate 10 minutes every day to practice typing.**
Practicing a short time daily is better than hours intermittently.
No skipping or compromises. Consistency is key.

**2. Learn the correct basic typing technique.**
[typing.com](https://typing.com)

This site is great to start with.
The exercizes are gamified and fun, progressively teaching the correct keyboard finger placement.

Target 30 words per minute (wpm), before moving on to the next step.

The topic of wpm is actually more layered than one thinks it is. I will make a future post about why this is and my observations.

**4. Move to keybr**
[keybr.com](https://keybr.com)

In the settings switch off:
- Stop cursor on error
- Forgive errors
Leaving them on gives a false sense of security/accomplishment in the long run.

The words on keybr are overall longer than typing.com, but not too long.

Target 60wpm with 95% accuracy, before moving on to the next step.

**5.  Move to Monkeytype
[Monkeytype.com](https://monkeytype.com)

On the start test screen,
Enable in the top bar:
- punctuation
- words
- 50 words
Below the top bar pick the following wordset:
- English 25k 

Moving from keybr, you will see an initial drop in speed.
This is normal - you are working with a larger, unfamiliar word set and also typing more words per practice session.

Monkeytype is the platform where one can refine your typing and practice to get to that  sweet 100+ wpm zone.

I am still experimenting with settings on monkeytype and will share future updates as I uncover more.

# How will my first week look like when starting out?
It is going.
To suck.
Big time.

You will want to quit 2 days in.

Why?
- Typing is frustratingly slow.
- Spelling mistakes are aplenty.
- Pinky and wrist discomfort.
- Swearing.

However, all these things WILL pass.

Remember, this is an S-curve skill type you are acquiring.
The big returns will reveal themselves down the line.

Do those 10 minutes of typing practice daily.
It is worth the effort and you can do it!

# Why are keyboard rows offset?
Have you ever wondered why your keyboard rows are a bit offset from one another?

I always thought it served some purpose.
Turns out, it does.

Historically.
For manual typewriters.

For a manual typewriter, each key is connected to a typebar via a linkage system. The typebars are arranged in a basket and swing up to strike the ribbon and paper.
To prevent the typebars from colliding or jamming if adjacent keys were pressed in rapid succession, the keys were physically offset. 

This convention stuck with modern day keyboards, although physical collisions and jamming are not issues anymore.

QWERTY, named for the top-left key order, has become the standard layout.

However, this key layout was designed for practical reasons and not for typing speed / ergonomics.
New layouts have emerged focussing on the latter.

# Other Typing Layouts
Dvorak - places common letters on the home row for less finger travel. Has a high learning curve.
Colemak - Modern alternative to QWERTY. Keeps common shortcuts familiar but improves ergonomics.
AZERTY - French standard, switches A/Q and Z/W.
QWERTZ - German standard, swaps Z/Y from QWERTY.
Workman - Another modern layout focusing on finger comfort and hand alternation.
